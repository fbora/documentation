Install the latest version of the Interactive Brokers Gateway from:
https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16457&ns=T
the location of the application on disk:
~/Applications/

IBC is an open source software that starts the gateway automatically.
Download from git hub:
https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC
and ask for help on the following user google groups:
https://groups.io/g/ibcalpha for issues related to using IBC
https://groups.io/g/twsapi for issues related to IB API

add executing permissions to .sh files in Scripts directory
sudo chmod o+x *.sh */*.sh

Note that as of May 2020 there is an error in the ibcstart.sh script that was not fixed in the release.
see this thread on the google group https://groups.io/g/ibcalpha/topic/24239631#673
You need to download ibcstart.sh directly from github and replace the release file

on OSX the shell file that starts the gateway gives an error on the if ... fi statement on the bottom of the script
Comment if ... fi statement and replace with
echo exec "${IBC_PATH}/scripts/DisplayBannerAndLaunch.sh"
exec "${IBC_PATH}/scripts/DisplayBannerAndLaunch.sh"

In OSX Interactive Brokers Gateway can only be started with the lauchd daemon (chrontab does not work).
In ~/Library/LaunchAgents you need to write a file with the extension .plist that will create the job to start the application.

Sample start_ib_gateway.plist (normally you should be able to put days 1-5 range like crontab,
but for some reason it didn't work for me, so I had to put an entry for each day of the week)
The .plist needs to be loaded in the LaunchDaemons:
sudo launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/start_ib_gateway.plist
